**Why Use Room Database?**

Room Database is a tool that makes working with data in Android apps easier. 
Here’s why it’s useful:

**Easy to Use:**
It simplifies the code needed to work with databases.

**Error Checking:** 
It checks your database queries when you write them, catching mistakes early.

**Live Updates:**
It works well with LiveData, so your app’s display updates automatically when data changes.

**Works in the Background:** 
It supports coroutines, making it easy to do database work without slowing down your app.

**Saves Data Locally:**
It keeps your data stored on the device, so it’s available even if the app is closed or restarted.

In simple terms, Room Database makes handling local data in Android apps easier, safer, and more efficient.
